Hi. I'm a 24 year old programmer from Croatia. I like developing applications of all sorts and have been interested in doing so from a young age. Currently finishing my Masters degree at the Zagreb university of applied sciences.

Besides programming I enjoy video games, reading, drawing and listening to music.
